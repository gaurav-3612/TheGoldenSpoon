## ‚ú® Key Features

This project is packed with features designed to create a professional and engaging user experience:

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Built with Material-UI, the entire application adapts beautifully to any screen size, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
* **Dynamic Menu Page:**
    * **Live Filtering:** Users can instantly filter the menu by category (e.g., "North Indian," "South Indian").
    * **Live Sorting:** Menu items can be sorted by price (Low to High or High to Low) to help users find exactly what they're looking for.
    * **Quick View Modal:** Clicking on a menu item opens a "Quick View" modal with a larger image and more details, preventing the need for page reloads.
* **Smooth Animations:** Using the **Framer Motion** library, menu items gracefully animate into view, giving the application a polished and modern feel.
* **Functional Contact Form:** The contact page features a real, working contact form that sends messages directly to an email address using the **Web3Forms** third-party service, showcasing the ability to integrate with external APIs without a custom backend.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** The project follows best practices with a clean, organized, and reusable component structure.
